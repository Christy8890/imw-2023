                    After choosing my the topic, I started off by brainstorming and asking myself about the user. What does my target user want to gain from my posters? And then asked myself about CTA, what actions do I want my users to take after viewing this?

                    I quickly jumped into creating a UI palette consisting of primary colours and typography. I liked the settle cream with a pop of vibrant blue.  Roboto Mono reminds me on coding and web, so I decided to pair that up with Inter.

                <p>
                    Before I started coding, I booked a 1-1 with Peter Ha for some feedback. Here is where i realized that I didn’t really consider about the user experience aspect of it. Didn’t know exactly who’s going to looking at this, what will hook them in, what are they looking for and what do they need...ect

                <p>
                    After my chat with Peter, I went back to my inspo board and started brainstorming and trying to properly frame the problem this time. 

One of my feedback was that there wasn’t enough contrast, so I looked for a colour palette that’s dark mode + a bright colour. I also wanted my poster to have hook at the beginning to grab the users attention just like the some these example have.

I feel like if I stick to the first draft I made I wouldn’t have been satisfied with my work at the end. I learned a lot about what I like and dislike as a design and lessons about contrast (accessibility) and the importance of understanding the user experience from Peter Ha.</p>
                <p>I especially liked how I turn the initial static poster to an interactive digital poster that is able to bring users in a journey to explore the conference. Hooking the users from the moment they land on the page, then leading through the what the conference offers and lastly, encouraging the users to take action and register for the conference at the end.</p>
