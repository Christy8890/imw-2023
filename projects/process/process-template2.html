                <p>
                    The first step of my process is reviewing the project brief and brainstorming based on the given prompts on Figma. The prompt I chose was “what’s something you daydream about”, I thought about some non-fictional and fun fictional story ideas. The one I went ahead with was growing tomatoes! I thought it was fun to bring users to the journey of growing vegetables.

                <h2>2. Visual Research</h2>
                <p>
                    During Visual research, I went to Pinterest to grab some simple instructional images to get some inspiration. At first I misunderstood the assignment briefly and thought we could use images, but after consulting with Peter, I realised I had to look for more simpler shapes and elements Im able to code purely with CSS. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After doing some digging, I was very inspired by very simple, but vibrant character shapes. I loved ones with cute smiley faces on fruits, since I was doing tomatoes I thought that would be perfect.

                <p>
                    Next, I designed a set of UI elements to base off of when I code the storybook. This includes some potential buttons I want to use, illustrations and typography.

                <p>
                    Then, I went ahead with storyboarding the flow of the web pages and adding in the copy. I went with a more linear storytelling method.

                <p>
                    Next I explored different ways I would want to lay out my story. However, after consulting with Peter, we both agree that it was lacking a bit of interactive-ness. There was only one page and it was only scrollable and clickable. So I went back to redo my wireframes.

                    My 2nd draft consisted of 5 pages of scrollable and clickable buttons that brought users to the next and previous pages.

                <p>
                    After that I went straight to the high-fidelity wireframes, laying out all the UI elements and exploring different types of design choices.

                <p>
                    Then, I tested out the design as an interactive prototype to take a look at the navigation.

                    Finally, I began coding. This was done on a test html file. There were lots of errors with my code such as spacing issues and random spacing at the bottom. It wasn’t processing as I was hoping.
