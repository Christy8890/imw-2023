                    My first few sets prototype involves creating a puzzle game. Users can resize the puzzle pieces and put it together to reveal the object. 

I like the 3rd one the most. It has a template of the final shape already int he background and the user will just have to find the correct pieces within a pile of wrong puzzle pieces

                    During my feedback session with Peter, I showed him the puzzle game prototype that I created. However, I did felt like it was too surface level. Peter advised me to dig deeper into “resize” and suggest me to ask more questions about it. 
                </p>
                <p>I realized here that I never went and research the history behind this feature and why it’s an important interaction within the digital space. I explored...what if this feature disappeared for a day? How would that effect user’s overall experience? What platforms use this feature the most? </p>
                <p>I found out a lot of facts I didn’t know about this feature and I was inspired by it.</p>

                <p>
                    After my chat with Peter, I went back to my inspo board and started brainstorming and trying to properly frame the problem this time. 

One of my feedback was that there wasn’t enough contrast, so I looked for a colour palette that’s dark mode + a bright colour. I also wanted my poster to have hook at the beginning to grab the users attention just like the some these example have.

                <p>I also added italics to the web on the title to match the top. I think it made a big difference. </p>
                <p>I did the same with the “Save the Date” section. One of my favourite iteration was adding “Add to Calendar” button. This will bring users directly to their Google Calendar!</p>

                <p>Looking back, I’m happy that I went out of my way to explore different types of design layouts. I feel like if I stick to the first draft I made I wouldn’t have been satisfied with my work at the end. I learned a lot about what I like and dislike as a design and lessons about contrast (accessibility) and the importance of understanding the user experience from Peter Ha.</p>
                <p>I especially liked how I turn the initial static poster to an interactive digital poster that is able to bring users in a journey to explore the conference. Hooking the users from the moment they land on the page, then leading through the what the conference offers and lastly, encouraging the users to take action and register for the conference at the end.</p>
