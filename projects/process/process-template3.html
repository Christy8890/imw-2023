                    Block puzzle game on the order hand doesn’t involve the users resizing anything, but I could potentially add that as a new feature</p>

                    My first few sets prototype involves creating a puzzle game. Users can resize the puzzle pieces and put it together to reveal the object. 

I like the 3rd one the most. It has a template of the final shape already int he background and the user will just have to find the correct pieces within a pile of wrong puzzle pieces

                    During my feedback session with Peter, I showed him the puzzle game prototype that I created. However, I did felt like it was too surface level. Peter advised me to dig deeper into “resize” and suggest me to ask more questions about it. 
                </p>
                <p>I realized here that I never went and research the history behind this feature and why it’s an important interaction within the digital space. I explored...what if this feature disappeared for a day? How would that effect user’s overall experience? What platforms use this feature the most? </p>
                <p>I found out a lot of facts I didn’t know about this feature and I was inspired by it.</p>

As they size down the window, it will reveal each letter of the 5-letter word that I hid within the images. At the end they can click “reveal word” and they will be able to see if they guess the word correctly.</p>

                <p>As I reflect, I definitely felt like this was the hardest assignment for me because I was so comfortable creating simple and traditional websites. I really had to think outside of the box and emphasize the “resize” interaction. My initial idea was way too surface level and I’m glad I consulted with Peter about my progress. He brainstormed alongside with me and encourage me to  do more research about this interaction. I did struggle a lot in the progress and had to take on an extension for this project , but I’m glad I did!!! I definitely needed the extra time to understand my interaction more and explore more ways to approach it</p>
